# CSS Grid: Task Board

In this project, you will create a board of to-do items organized into columns. All of the HTML and most of the CSS have been written for you, but the grid property declarations have yet to be added.

In order to complete this project, you must know how to lay out the structure of a grid’s rows and columns and place items within that grid using CSS.

We recommend that you review our CSS Grid Essentials lesson before beginning.

The premade index.html and style.css files are displayed for you. Click this link to see the completed project in another tab. Have fun!
